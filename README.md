# Random Gen 1 Pokemon and Special Move Generator

This project is a JavaScript-based Random Pokémon Generator that selects a random Pokémon from the original Generation 1 (Kanto region) Pokémon. Each generated Pokémon comes with a random type and a unique special move. The application uses simple functions to generate random numbers and select random elements from predefined arrays containing Pokémon names, types, and special moves. The generator iterates over these arrays, constructs a descriptive message, and outputs the result in a formatted string. This project is a fun and interactive way to explore the classic Pokémon characters and their potential abilities.
